BLACK HOLES Hawking radiation is a theoretical prediction that black holes emit a faint glow of radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon, causing them to lose mass over time HAWKING RADIATION. BLACK HOLES The study of black holes has also led to the development of string theory, which attempts to reconcile general relativity and quantum mechanics STRING THEORY. BLACK HOLES Black holes are surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull EVENT HORIZON. BLACK HOLES Scientists study black holes to understand their formation, properties, and implications for physics and cosmology SCIENTISTS. BLACK HOLES Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have undergone a supernova explosion SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION.
