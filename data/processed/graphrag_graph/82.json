      "description": "A phenomenon where individuals feel they have experienced a current situation before, despite it being the first time it is happening. It is a mysterious and largely unexplained occurrence that has intrigued scientists, psychologists, and the general public for centuries. Theories about its cause include dual processing and memory-based explanations, and factors like stress, fatigue, and creativity can increase its frequency. Despite extensive research, the phenomenon remains elusive and difficult to study in a controlled environment.|"
