BUTTERFLY The adult stage is the final stage of the butterfly's life cycle, where the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, feeds on nectar, and plays a crucial role in pollination. ADULT STAGE. BUTTERFLY After the egg hatches, the larva stage begins, where the caterpillar emerges and feeds on leaves, growing rapidly. The larva stage is the second stage of the butterfly's life cycle. LARVA STAGE. BUTTERFLY The pupa stage is the third stage of the butterfly's life cycle, where the caterpillar forms a chrysalis and undergoes metamorphosis to transform into a butterfly. PUPA STAGE. CHRYSALIS The pupa forms a chrysalis, a protective shell where metamorphosis occurs. PUPA. CATERPILLAR At the end of the larva stage, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis, which is a protective shell where metamorphosis occurs. CHRYSALIS. CHRYSALIS The pupa forms a chrysalis, a protective shell where metamorphosis occurs. PUPA. CATERPILLAR During the pupa stage, the caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis, a process where its body transforms into a butterfly. METAMORPHOSIS.",
