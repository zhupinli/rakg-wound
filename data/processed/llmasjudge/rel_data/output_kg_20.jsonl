virtual reality can cater to different learning styles and preferences, making education more inclusive and accessible to a diverse range of students., Despite the numerous benefits of virtual reality in education, there are also challenges and considerations that need to be addressed when implementing this technology in classrooms., One of the key advantages of using virtual reality in education is its ability to create immersive and engaging learning experiences., By harnessing the power of VR technology, educators can enhance student learning outcomes, promote creativity and critical
