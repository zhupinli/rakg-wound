{"chunk_text": "Cloud formation begins with the warming of the Earth's surface by the sun., Cumulus clouds are typically associated with fair weather, but they can also develop into larger, more vertically developed clouds known as cumulonimbus clouds, which can bring thunderstorms and heavy rain., Cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals and are often seen in the sky on clear days., These clouds are often gray and can bring overcast skies and light rain., Cumulus clouds are fluffy, white clouds that are often seen on a sunny day., Temperature, humidity, and air currents all play a role in cloud formation, influencing the types of clouds that are observed in the sky., The process of condensation is crucial to cloud formation, as it is the mechanism by which water vapor in the air transforms into visible clouds., These tiny droplets or crystals then come together to form clouds., By understanding how clouds form, we can gain a greater appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the natural world around us.```, These differences in temperature and humidity can lead to the formation of different types of clouds, such as cumulus, stratus, and cirrus clouds., When the air reaches its dew point, the water vapor in the air begins to condense into tiny water droplets or ice crystals., These clouds form when warm air rises rapidly and cools quickly, causing the water vapor in the air to condense into cumulus clouds., ```Clouds are a fascinating natural phenomenon that can be observed in the sky on a daily basis., In conclusion, clouds form through the process of condensation, which occurs when warm, moist air rises and cools, leading to the condensation of water vapor into tiny droplets or ice crystals., These clouds form at high altitudes where the air is very cold and dry., Stratus clouds form when warm, moist air is lifted gently and cools slowly, leading to the gradual condensation of water vapor into stratus clouds., Stratus clouds, on the other hand, are low-lying clouds that form in a more uniform layer across the sky., They are formed through a complex process involving the interaction of various factors such as temperature, humidity, and air currents., Cirrus clouds are high, wispy clouds that are thin and delicate in appearance., In addition to temperature and humidity, air currents also play a significant role in cloud formation., In this essay, we will explore how clouds form and the different types of clouds that can be observed in the sky.", "entity": {"name": "Clouds", "type": "Natural Phenomenon", "description": "Low-lying
