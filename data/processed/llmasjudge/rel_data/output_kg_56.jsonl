{"chunk_text": "The safety bicycle featured two wheels of equal size, a chain drive system, and pneumatic tires, making it more stable, comfortable, and efficient than its predecessors., While the draisine was a significant innovation in transportation at the time, it was limited in its practicality and efficiency., In the late 19th century, the safety bicycle was invented, revolutionizing the way people rode bikes., ```The Evolution of the Bicycle\n\nThe bicycle, a two-wheeled vehicle propelled by human power, has a rich history of evolution and innovation that spans centuries., The introduction of electric bikes in recent years has further expanded the options for cyclists, offering motorized assistance for easier riding and longer distances., In the early 1900s, steel became the primary material used in bicycle frames, offering strength and durability at a reasonable cost., From sleek racing bikes with dropped handlebars to comfortable cruisers with upright seating positions, there is a wide range of bicycle styles available to suit every type of rider., As we look to the future, it is exciting to imagine what new advancements and developments will shape the next chapter in the evolution of this beloved two-wheeled vehicle.```, From its humble beginnings as a wooden contraption in the early 19th century to the sleek, lightweight carbon fiber machines of today, the bicycle has undergone numerous transformations that have shaped its design, function, and impact on society., This distinctive bicycle featured a large front wheel and a smaller rear wheel, giving it a high center of gravity and a precarious ride., Carbon fiber frames are lightweight, strong, and aerodynamic, making them ideal for competitive racing and high-performance cycling., In conclusion, the evolution of the bicycle is a testament to human ingenuity, creativity, and perseverance., The introduction of the safety bicycle marked a turning point in the history of cycling, leading to a surge in popularity and widespread adoption of the new technology., In addition to advancements in materials, the design of bicycles has also evolved over time to meet the changing needs and preferences of riders., The evolution of the bicycle has had a profound impact on society, influencing transportation, recreation, and culture in significant ways., The earliest known prototype of the bicycle dates back to the early 19th century when a German inventor named Baron Karl von Drais created a two-wheeled vehicle that he called the \"draisine.\" This early version of the bicycle had no pedals and was propelled by the rider pushing off the ground with their feet, much like a modern-day scooter., Throughout the 20th century, the bicycle continued to evolve with advancements in materials, design, and technology., While the penny-farthing was popular among wealthy gentlemen for its speed and elegance, it was also dangerous and prone to accidents due to its design., The next major milestone in the evolution of the bicycle came in the late 19th century with the invention of the high-wheel bicycle, also known as the penny-farthing., From its humble beginnings as a wooden contraption to its modern-day incarnation as a high-tech racing machine, the bicycle has come a long way in its journey of innovation and improvement., The use of carbon fiber in bicycle manufacturing has transformed the industry, leading to the development of advanced racing bikes that are faster, more agile, and more responsive than ever before., Bicycles have become a popular mode of transportation for commuting, exercise, and leisure, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to cars and public transportation., The boneshaker was a significant improvement over the draisine, offering a smoother ride and greater speed, but it was still heavy and cumbersome, making it difficult to maneuver on rough terrain., It wasn't until the mid-19th century that the bicycle underwent a major evolution with the invention of the velocipede, also known as the \"boneshaker.\" This early bicycle featured pedals attached directly to the front wheel, allowing riders to propel themselves forward by turning the pedals in a circular motion.", "entity": {"name": "Bicycle", "type": "Vehicle", "description": "The structural framework of a bicycle that supports the rider and
