{"chunk_text": "One of the key reasons why coral reefs are so important is their role in supporting marine biodiversity., Despite their importance, coral reefs are facing numerous threats that are putting these valuable ecosystems at risk., The complex structure of coral reefs offers hiding places, breeding grounds, and food sources for a wide range of marine life, contributing to the overall health and resilience of ocean ecosystems., Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are causing coral bleaching, a phenomenon in which corals expel the algae that live in their tissues, leading to the death of the coral colonies., ```Coral reefs are often referred to as the \"rainforests of the sea\" due to their incredible biodiversity and importance to marine ecosystems., One of the most important services provided by coral reefs is coastal protection., Despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor, coral reefs are home to an estimated 25% of all marine species., In regions prone to hurricanes and tsunamis, coral reefs act as natural barriers that help to mitigate the destructive effects of these natural disasters., These underwater ecosystems are made up of tiny animals called coral polyps that secrete calcium carbonate to form intricate structures that provide shelter and food for a wide variety of marine life., The intricate structure of coral reefs helps to dissipate wave energy, reducing the impact of storms and protecting coastal communities from erosion and flooding., Pollution from land-based sources, such as agricultural runoff and plastic waste, is also impacting coral reefs by smothering corals and introducing harmful chemicals into the marine environment., By attracting visitors to these marine ecosystems, coral reefs also help to raise awareness about the importance of marine conservation and the need to protect these fragile habitats for future generations., Coral reefs support local fisheries by providing a source of income and livelihood for coastal communities that depend on fishing for their sustenance., In conclusion, coral reefs are invaluable ecosystems that play a vital role in supporting marine biodiversity, providing ecosystem services, and contributing to human well-being., Furthermore, coral reefs are important for their role in promoting tourism and recreation., Coral reefs are popular destinations for divers and snorkelers, attracting millions of tourists each year to coastal areas around the world., Coral reefs are vital to the health of our oceans and play a crucial role in supporting both marine and human life., Coral reefs also play a crucial role in supporting fisheries and providing food security for millions of people around the world., In addition, coral reefs contribute to global food security by supporting sustainable fisheries that provide protein-rich food sources for people in developing countries., In addition to supporting marine biodiversity, coral reefs also provide a range of ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being., By taking action to protect and preserve coral reefs, we can ensure the health and resilience of our oceans and secure a sustainable future for both marine and human life.```, Marine protected areas should be established to safeguard coral reefs and promote sustainable management of marine resources., The beauty and diversity of coral reefs make them valuable assets for the tourism industry, generating revenue and supporting local economies., These ecosystems provide a habitat for a vast array of marine organisms, including fish, invertebrates, and plants., Climate change, ocean acidification, pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices are all contributing to the decline of coral reefs worldwide., Many commercially important fish species rely on coral reefs for food, shelter, and breeding grounds.", "entity": {"name": "Coral reefs", "type": "Geographical Feature", "description":
