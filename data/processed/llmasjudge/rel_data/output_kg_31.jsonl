{"chunk_text": "The United States, for example, divided the country into four time zones: Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific., The development of time zones was further refined with the introduction of Daylight Saving Time (DST) in the early 20th century., In 1847, the British railway companies adopted a single standard time for their schedules, known as Railway Time., Before the advent of standardized time measurement, communities used local solar time based on the position of the sun in the sky., Time zones have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping how we

on a global scale and ensuring that everyone is on the same page when it comes to scheduling events and meetings., The conference also divided the world into 24 time zones, each spanning 15 degrees of longitude., ```Time zones have played a crucial role in shaping the way we perceive and organize time across the world., The concept of time zones as we know them today was first proposed by Sir Sandford Fleming, a Canadian engineer, in the late 19th century., From the early days of local solar time to the standardized system of time zones we use today, the evolution of timekeeping has been driven by the need for efficiency and coordination across vast distances., In recent years, advances in technology and communication have made coordinating time across different time zones easier than ever., Following the adoption of standard time zones at the International Meridian Conference, countries around the world began to implement the new system., Other countries followed suit, adjusting their timekeeping practices to align with the new standard., The need for time zones arose with the expansion of global trade and transportation networks., Trains and telegraphs, in particular, highlighted the inefficiencies of using local time across long distances., The first major development in timekeeping came with the introduction of standard time in the mid-19th century., The concept of time zones has evolved over centuries, reflecting the need to standardize time measurement and synchronize activities across vast distances., Fleming suggested dividing the world into 24 time
